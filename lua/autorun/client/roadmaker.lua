	==================================================
	Hammer Road Maker
	==================================================
	Public alpha version: 1.0
	
	Includes a VMF Generator library.
	I was in a hurry when I made this version.
	Therefore, it may contain a significant amount of shitty coding.
	
	Available primitives of VMF Generator:
		- Convex Box
		- Wedge
		- Box (not exist)
